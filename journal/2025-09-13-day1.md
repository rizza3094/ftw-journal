# Journal — {{09-13-2025}} — {{Data Engineering Track Day 1}}

## 1) What I learned (bullets, not prose)
- Use of docker
- Use of DBeaver
- Virtual Studio Code 
- Test and Experiment dataset
- SQL query in Dbeaver
- Metabase basics

## 2) New vocabulary (define in your own words)
- **ELT** — Extract, Transform and Load- transforming data using a separate server before transferring it to data warehouse
-  **ELT** — Extract, Load, and Transform- raw data is directly sent to warehouse that eliminates the needs for staging process
-  **DTL** — Data Load Tool- software that import, move or transform data

## 3) Data Engineering mindset applied (what principles did I use?)
- Accuracy of SQL query yield results that may or may not answer your problem

## 4) Decisions & assumptions (why, alternatives, trade-offs)
- 

## 5) Open questions (things I still don’t get)
-  Use of Git

## 6) Next actions (small, doable steps)
- [ I need to take the Introduction to Git at Data Camp to be familiar with git. ] 

## 7) Artifacts & links (code, queries, dashboards)
- https://www.sql-practice.com/

### Mini reflection (3–5 sentences)
What surprised me? What would I do differently next time? What will I watch out for in production?

I was surprised at how powerful Git is for tracking every change and keeping my work organized. I will try to learn more about git. 

### BONUS: What is a meme that best describes what you feel or your learning today?
